Project Title: Heart Disease Prediction Model (Backend)

Description:
This project was developed as part of an IBM Workshop on Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AI/ML). The objective was to build the backend of a Heart Disease Prediction Model that analyzes medical data to assess the likelihood of heart disease.

Using Python and key data science libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, the backend focuses on data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization to uncover relationships among various health parameters, including age, blood pressure, cholesterol, and heart rate.

The project involved cleaning and preparing the dataset, handling missing values, exploring feature correlations, and creating meaningful visual representations to identify patterns and trends relevant to heart disease.

Key Features:

1.Conducted data cleaning and transformation using Pandas and NumPy

2.Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify key health indicators

3.Created statistical and visual insights with Matplotlib and Seaborn

4.Designed a modular backend structure ready for future model integration or API deployment

Tools & Technologies:

1.Language: Python

2.Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn

3.Platform: IBM AI/ML Workshop

Domain: Healthcare Data Analytics

Outcome:
The backend successfully provided a clean and analyzed dataset with visual insights that serve as a strong foundation for integrating a machine learning model capable of predicting heart disease risk. The project demonstrated practical understanding of data analysis workflows and AI/ML pipeline preparation under IBM’s mentorship framework.
